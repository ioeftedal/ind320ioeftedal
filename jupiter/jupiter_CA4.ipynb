    "### Use of AI\n",
    "- AI was used a lot for the streamlit. For the jupiter notebook i did not use ai at all for this assignment, but i might have used it for assignment 2. Therefore the code might be somewhat ai generated, but all of what was editet for this assignment was done without external help. It was mostly fairly simple to use previous code and make some small altercations to get the code that i needed for this assignment. For the streamlit i used ai to convert the matplotlib plots all to plotly so that they are more dynamic. I also used a lot of ai to create my pages as well as for debugging. Most of the work done without the use of ai was getting the right data as well as making the plan and architecture for the project. When it came to the decision of what libraries to use, adding simple features or making extensive changes i usually did them myself to lay a foundation for the ai to alter on later. I found that doing everything with ai there would be a lot of mistakes as weird code snippets. For example i experimented with trying claude, but it wrote way too much code for my taste which made me lose control of what was being implemented so i did not use it. And just stuck with using the free tier of chatgpt that rather gives small snippets to implement.\n",

    "### Log of compulsary work\n",
    "- Working on this project was a mix of smooth experiences and real challenges. I found doing the jupiter notebook the easiest as it was very similar to the second assignment so there was a lot i could take of code from there. Retrieving hourly production data from the Elhub API and processing it for storage in MongoDB and Cassandra felt straightforward. Overall, the Jupyter part felt understandable and manageable, and I actually enjoyed diving into the data exploration and processing steps. \n",
    "- In contrast, the Streamlit app turned out to be much harder. Refactoring static plots into dynamic Plotly visualizations was rewarding, but figuring out page structure, menus, and interactive selections required a lot more trial and error than I expected. The mapping component, in particular, has been tricky. While I successfully integrated GeoJSON overlays for the Price areas and implemented interactive features like storing clicked coordinates and highlighting selected areas, I ran into a frustrating issue: the map only renders properly in Safari and doesn’t display at all in Chrome. This has been a major headache, and I’ve spent a lot of time trying to troubleshoot it without a complete solution yet. Despite this, seeing the map work on safari felt exciting, and it’s satisfying to know the underlying logic is correct. Other aspects of Streamlit, like snow drift calculations, wind rose visualizations, and dynamic forecasting with SARIMAX, were challenging but fun once they started working. I especially liked seeing the results respond interactively to user input. \n",

    "### Experience with jupiter notebook and streamlit\n",
    "- This time it all pretty much went smooth, apart from forgetting to save files occasionally which was frustrating but not really a jupiter or streamlit problem. This is the assigmnet where i have enjoyed working with jupiter notebooks the most and still really enjoyed streamlit. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Choice of additional task\n",
    "Forecasting\n",
    "- Add eather properties to the list exoogenous variables and download them when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection\n",
    "Using the Streamlit sliding window correlation tool, I might have noticed some correlations between meteorological variables and energy production or consumption are subtle under normal conditions. However, during extreme weather events, patterns might become somwhat more pronounced for example, energy demand increases when it gets very hot or very cold. I also notice that sometimes the effects don’t happen immediately, there can be a bit of a delay before the energy response shows up. Overall, the correlations are most pronounced during unusual or intense weather events if there are any.\n",
